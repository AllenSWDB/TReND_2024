Possible metrics are preferred features (e.g. preferred orientation, preferred SF, preferred TF, preferred image), selectivity (e.g. direction selectivity, orientation selectivity, image selectivity, lifetime sparseness), and reliability or variability. \n",

    "<h1> Exercise 3:  Predicting neural responses from tuning curves. </h1>\n",
    "    \n",
    "We would like to be able to predict neural responses given a stimulus input.  How well does this work for neurons in our dataset?    \n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to ask what this question means.  We will consider the response to the drifting grating stimulus.  We need a model for neural response, which in this case we will take to be the simple model that the neuron responds with a given level of activity in response to a given stimulus configuration, plus an amount of noise.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will use the LinearRegression module from scikit-learn for this exercise.  We'll follow a set of steps similar to the example of decoding from the tutorial.\n",
    "    \n",
    "a. First we need to create a \"design matrix\" for the input.  In this case we will use \"one-hot encoding\".  For each presentation of the drifting grating stimulus, we will have 41 conditions.  8 directions * 5 temporal frequencies plus 1 blank sweep.  Assign each one an index.  Using the stimulus table, create a design matrix of shape (number of trials, 41) where each entry is 1 if the stimulus condition on that trial corresponds to that index and is zero otherwise.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "b. Create a LinearRegression instance similar to how we created a LogisticRegression instance in the tutorial.  Fit the model following similar steps, where in the \"inputs\" are given by the design matrix you constructed in part a and the outputs are the neuron's response.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "c. How well does this model work?  Similar to the tutorial, plot the tuning curves at each temporal frequency along with the individual trials.  Compute the \"score\" given by scikit-learn.  Do the neuron's with better scores make sense based on the tuning curve plots?\n",
    "    \n",
    "d. The above gives a \"best case scenario\" for the models, because we fit on all the available data.  A better assessment of the model performance requires testing on data that was not used for fitting.  How would you split the available data into \"test\" and \"train\" datasets?  Try splitting the data into the first half of trials and second half.  Next randomly assign trials across the session to the train and test sets. How does this impact your results?  \n",
