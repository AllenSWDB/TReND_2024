This capsule contains materials for the two Allen Institute days for the TReND-CaMiNa course. They serve to introduce students to the Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding Optical Physiology dataset and help them gain familiarity with how to work with the data.

The capsule has four notebooks: 

- Day 1 - Data access.ipynb
- Day 1 - Neural tuning.ipynb:
- Day 2 - neural variability.ipynb
- Day 2 - population decoding.ipynb

The `Solutions` folder contains completed versions of these notebooks.

More information on the dataset can be found in our JupyterBook: https://allenswdb.github.io/physiology/ophys/visual-coding/vc2p-background.html
